# Diabetes-Classification

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Approach

The dataset comprised several medical predictor variables, such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and more. As a dedicated machine learning enthusiast, I constructed multiple classification models to identify the most accurate approach. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm emerged as the best performing model.

The KNN model excelled in predicting diabetes outcomes by leveraging the similarity between instances and classifying new data points based on their proximity to existing instances in the dataset. Its ability to discern patterns and relationships in the data, combined with the suitability of the KNN algorithm for this specific problem, resulted in remarkable performance.

By implementing this project, I gained valuable experience in feature selection, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. I also honed my skills in Python programming, data visualization, and applied statistical analysis. With a meticulous approach to model development and a commitment to continuous improvement, I ensured the reliability and effectiveness of the final solution.****
